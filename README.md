# cancer-cell-classification
In this project, I used the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn and applied the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) classifier to predict whether tumors are malignant or benign. The model was trained on the dataset's features, and performance was evaluated based on accuracy, providing insights into early cancer detection.
